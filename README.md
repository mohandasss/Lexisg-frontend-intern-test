## Notes

This is a frontend-only simulation with hardcoded responses and one example PDF citation. There is no backend integration.




## Citation Handling

The app displays a citation below the legal answer. Clicking the citation opens the judgment PDF in a new browser tab.

In this project, the PDF used is:

**Dani Devi v. Pritam Singh**  
Law Finder Doc ID: 2060557  
Punjab and Haryana High Court – 2023(1) R.C.R.(Civil) 600

The relevant part of the citation appears in Paragraph 7:

> “as the age of the deceased at the time of accident was held to be about 54–55 years by the learned Tribunal, being self-employed, as such, 10% of annual income should have been awarded on account of future prospects.”

Since this is a frontend-only simulation, the paragraph scroll/highlight is mocked.
